# Hooky CLI

**Hooky CLI** is a command-line tool for managing Git hooks in Go projects. Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, Hooky makes it easy to set up, configure, and run Git hooks such as pre-commit, pre-push, and more. Whether youâ€™re enforcing coding standards, running tests, or automating tasks, Hooky streamlines the process in a Go-centric development workflow.
